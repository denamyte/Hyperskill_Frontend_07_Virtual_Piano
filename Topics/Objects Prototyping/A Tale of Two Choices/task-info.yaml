    \ of prototype properties, whereas the <code>__proto__</code> property does not."
  - text: "The <code>__proto__</code> property, although widely supported, was not standardized\
    \ until ECMAScript 6 and is considered a non-standard feature."
  - text: Overriding inherited properties is impossible when creating child objects
      with <code>__proto__</code>.
  - text: " <code>__proto__</code> property can only be used for single-level inheritance,\
    \ while using <code>Object.create()</code> you can create complex inheritance\
    \ structures."
  - text: "With <code>Object.create()</code>, you can explicitly define the prototype\
    \ object for the newly created object and have direct control over the prototype\
    \ chain."
